By Creating the table with the link the foreign key is created inside the secondary table.
such as if student table and with the class table.
the student gone in many classes. 
there should have a enrollment table which is the tables consist of data from student table and class table. which make it normalize.
the table enrollment should consist of foreign keys that point to student table primary key and another foreign key that point to the class table primary key.

if there do not have enrollment table and not allow to create additional table. this make us to use class table as the join table.
the foreign key need to created inside class table. this will make the table unnormalize, but still workable.

another example of sales table and salesitem table.

CREATE TABLE DUMM.SALESN
(sales_no    NUMBER NOT NULL,
 sale_place  VARCHAR2(5)   NOT NULL,
 amount      number,
sales_gender varchar2(1),
sales_comment varchar2(50),
CONSTRAINT salesn_pk PRIMARY KEY (sales_no) USING INDEX TABLESPACE SALES_TBS
)
TABLESPACE SALES_TBS;

CREATE TABLE DUMM.SALESITEM
(sales_no    NUMBER NOT NULL,
 itemid  NUMBER NOT NULL,
 itemcost      number,
item_description varchar2(50),
CONSTRAINT itemidn_pk PRIMARY KEY (itemid) USING INDEX TABLESPACE SALES_TBS,
CONSTRAINT itemidn_fk FOREIGN KEY (sales_no) REFERENCES DUMM.SALESN(sales_no)
)
TABLESPACE SALES_TBS;

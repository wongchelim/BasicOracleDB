For standard gather stat command as per below.
EXEC DBMS_STATS.GATHER_TABLE_STATS(ownname => 'DUMM',tabname => 'SALES');
Above will use all the defaults values as per according to your database gather stat parameter setting.

If require to have more specific custom setting please refer below link as per according to your DB version

https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/12.2/arpls/DBMS_STATS.html#GUID-CA6A56B9-0540-45E9-B1D7-D78769B7714C

If before gather there are data inside below view
select table_owner,table_name,partition_name,SUBPARTITION_NAME,inserts,updates,deletes,timestamp from dba_tab_modifications where upper(table_name) like upper('&tablename');

once you execute below on that table it will disappaer from above view.
execute dbms_stats.gather_table_stats(ownname=> 'DUMM',tabname=> 'SALES' ,estimate_percent=> DBMS_STATS.AUTO_SAMPLE_SIZE,granularity=> 'ALL',block_sample=> FALSE, cascade=> TRUE,degree=> DBMS_STATS.DEFAULT_DEGREE, method_opt=> 'FOR ALL COLUMNS SIZE AUTO');


But do becareful as nothing are right forever.
there are certain application not allow to update statistic on certain table, this is to avoid certain changes inside their database. such as SQL plan changes can be avoided.
to able to achieve controling the statistic of certain table to control the execution plan, this will need a lot of knowlege on that application and extra work to administrate the DB.
the best practise is to have the latest and updated statistic to let optimizer to manage the execution of the queries.

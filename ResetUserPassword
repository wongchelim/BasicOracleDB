To reset a user password might be very easy with commands available over the web.
But what I'm demo here is one of the special cases.

To reset a special username with special character
alter user "ALAN_CH''NG" identified by "RandomPass_123" password expire;

*Note, the reason with the "password expire" is to let the user to reset their own password once he/she login using a Random password at first time.
Majority large enterprise DBA are not responsible to help keeping password for user and not know their password for security reason.

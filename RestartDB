This is to explain the restart of the Oracle DB 12c.
Of course, if you just you alone using the DB as test environment might be no need to consider much of restarting the DB.
But for the production DB that currently accessed by many users. You need to perform this VERY VERY carefull.

Scan for any active sessions
==========================================
select username,count(*)Â from gv$session where type='USER' and status='ACTIVE' group by username;

Clear all users sessions if needed. Check all of them related to any crucial processes. 
Once all processes clarified with respective owner done.

We can now shutdown the DB.
============================
SQL> shutdown immediate;

Or
Noted. If oracle clusterware installed... Issue below at the command prompt
srvctl stop database

To start back.
==========================================
SQL> startup;

or 
Noted. If oracle clusterware installed... Issue below at the command prompt
srvctl start database
